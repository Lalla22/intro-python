# FUNCTIONS

# A function is like a mini-program within a program.
def hello():
    print('Howdy!')
    print('Howdy!!!')
    print('Hello there.')

# Can you run the function hello()?


def hello_friend(name):
    print('Howdy, ' + name)

# Can you say Howdy to your code buddy?


### Exercise: Can you write a function that:
# Takes in your name and the language you are learning
# Prints out an Introduction for yourself
# Bonus -- if you are learning 'python', then it prints out 'Cool!'
# Hint - google python 'if' statement


### Bonus Exercise: Extra Credit
# Write a Palindrome Detection function
# Takes in a string and returns a boolean if the string is a palindrome
# Hint: It might require some data cleaning, check out 02_strings.py
# Hint: google 'python boolean equality'

palindrome_one = 'racecar'


palindrome_two = 'step on no pets'
