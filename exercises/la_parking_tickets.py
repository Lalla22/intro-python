    "Exploring Los Angeles Parking Citations Data"

    Starter code for exploring parking citations.

    Data source: City of Los Angeles Open Data Portal
    https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/Parking-Citations/wjz9-h9np

    Nathan @nate_somewhere

    Warning:

    The dataset downloaded has 9.5 million plus rows 
    and takes several minutes to download.

    By default, a smaller 500k row dataset is in the exercises/data folder that you should
    use for development until you are ready to run the whole batch.

    Class notes:

    Python3 required, python2 not guaranteed to work completely
    Internet connection required
    Text editor required

# Can you think of any other ways of preprocessing the data to speed things up?
